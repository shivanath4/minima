## Who and Why and What? 
Hello! This is Shivanath (23M). I consider myself curious. I'm going to try and think about the why of this blog. Firstly, I believe that writing about some concept that you want to know about forces you to think more. It's also tougher. So secondly, making it public would hopefully hold me accountable. And the output would be shareable and would be of more quality this way. Right now, I'm thinking of posting summaries of podcasts / books and some explorations of ideas I'm doing with myself / friends. If you can add to these in any way, I would be more than happy. Hope you have a satisfying stay!
